        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun</p>
        <p>Uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system</p>
        <p> It was discovered in 1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel and named after the Greek sky god Uranus.</p>
        <p>Unlike the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, there is no metallic hydrogen in the bowels of Uranus and Neptune similar to it, but there is a lot of ice in its high-temperature modifications. For this reason, experts have identified these two planets in a separate category of "ice giants". The basis of the atmosphere of Uranus is hydrogen and helium. In addition, traces of methane and otherhydrocarbons, as well as clouds of ice, solid ammonia and hydrogen. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C). It is believed that Uranus has a complex layered structure of clouds, where water is the bottom layer, and methane is the top. The bowels of Uranus consist mainly of ice and rocks.</p>

        <p>Just like the gas giants of the solar system, Uranus has a system of rings and a magnetosphere, and in addition, 27 satellites. The orientation of Uranus in space differs from the rest of the planets of the solar system - its axis of rotation lies, as it were, "on its side" relative to the plane of revolution of this planet around the Sun. As a result, the planet is turned to the Sun alternately with the north pole, then the south, then the equator, then the middle latitudes.</p>
        <p>In 1986, the American spacecraft Voyager 2 transmitted close-up images of Uranus to Earth. They show an "inexpressive" planet in the visible spectrum without cloud bands and atmospheric storms characteristic of other giant planets. However, at present, ground-based observations have been able to discern signs of seasonal changes and an increase in weather activity on the planet, caused by the approach of Uranus to its equinox. Wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 m/s (900 km/h).</p>
